# Convert to An HTML Document

You need to install a Markdown editor first. Taking the mdCharm as an example, select 'File' -> 'Export to...' -> Tick the 'HTML' -> Click the 'Browser...' -> Select the export directory of the export and enter the file name -> Click 'OK' to convert the current Markdown document to an HTML document.

NB: To find out which common Markdown editors are available, do your own Google.
