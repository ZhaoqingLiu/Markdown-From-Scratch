# Table

## Cell and Header

Using | to separate different cell, use - to separate header and other rows:

name | age
---- | ---
George | 30
Mike | 20

In order to aesthetic, you can use multiple Spaces to align cells in each row, and use | to mark each cell's boundary, although its display effect is exactly the same with the above:

| name   | age |
| ------ | --- |
| George | 30  |
| Mike   | 20  |


## Alignment
:---, ---:, and :--: mean bing aligned to the left, right, and center, respectively

| left      |      center      |      right |
| :---      |       :--:       |       ---: |
| aa        |      bb          |         cc |
